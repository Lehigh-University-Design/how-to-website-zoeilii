  <h2>Instruction</h2>
	  
	  <div class="steps1">
      <h3>Gather Materials</h3>
      <p>Collect all the materials and tools you'll need for building the birdhouse.</p>
      <h3>Design the Birdhouse:</h3>
      <p>Decide on the dimensions and design of your birdhouse. A simple design could include a rectangular box with a slanted roof. 
        A typical birdhouse could have dimensions of approximately 6x6x8 inches.</p>
     
	  <h4>Cut the Wood:</h4>
      <p>Using a saw, cut the 1x6 inch wood board into the necessary pieces: two sides, a front, a back, a bottom, and a roof</p>
		  
          <h5>Sand the Edges:</h5>
          <p>Use sandpaper to smooth out the edges of the cut pieces to prevent splinters and ensure a neat finish.</p>
		  
	      <h5>Assemble the Box:</h5>
          <p>Lay out the pieces to form the basic box shape. Apply wood glue to the edges 
		  of the sides, front, and back, then carefully attach them together. Use clamps
		  to hold the pieces in place while the glue dries. You can also reinforce the joints with nails or screws.
          </p>  
		  
          <h5>Attach the Bottom:</h5>
	      <p>Apply wood glue to the bottom edges of the box and attach the bottom piece. Secure it with nails or screws for extra stability.</p>
		  
	      <h5>Add the Roof</h5>
	      <p>Attach the roof piece to the top of the box.  Make sure it overhangs the front of the box slightly to provide some protection from rain. Secure it with nails or screws.</p>
		  </div>
		  
	      <div class="steps2">
	      <h5>Drill the Entry Hole:</h5>
          <p>Depending on the type of birds you want to attract, drill a hole near the top of the front piece for the entry hole. Different bird species have different preferences for entry hole size.</p>
		  
		  <h5>Decorate and Paint (Optional):</h5>
		  <p>If desired, you can add some decorative elements to the birdhouse. Make sure to use bird-safe paint and finishes.</p>
		  
		  <h5>Attach a Hanger:</h5>
		  <p>Screw or nail a small piece of wood to the top back of the birdhouse to create a hanger. This will allow you to hang. the birdhouse from a tree branch, hook, or post.</p>
		  
		  <h5>Install the Birdhouse:</h5>
		  <p>Screw or nail a small piece of wood to the top back of the birdhouse to create a hanger. This will allow you to hang. the birdhouse from a tree branch, hook, or post.</p>
		  
		  <h5>Enjoy Watching the Birds:</h5>
		  <p>Once the birdhouse is securely hung, all that's left to do is wait and enjoy watching the birds that might choose to make it their home.</p>

       <h2>Tips:</h2>
	   <p>Research the types of birds in your area to design the birdhouse to their preferences.
Avoid using pressure-treated wood or toxic finishes that could be harmful<br> to birds.
Clean out the birdhouse at the end of each nesting season to prepare for the next year's inhabitants.
With these steps, you'll have a basic birdhouse ready to provide shelter for your feathered friends.</br>
